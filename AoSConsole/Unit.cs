/* A unit of a number of models.
 * As attacks in AoS are made unit-to-unit, well, you get the picture.
 * The unit class contains methods for attacking, battleshock tests, and any other actions that are performed for a unit as a whole.
 * Also includes nice helper things for tidying up lists so that dead units are appropriately removed.
